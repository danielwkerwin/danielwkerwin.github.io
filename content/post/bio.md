No matter how hard I try, there is no short version to the story of my life. For the benefit of those of you who haven't already sat through my many attempts to refine the telling of my story, here is my best effort in written form.

I was Born in Melbourne, Australia on May 21st, 1988. Born to two American parents, with yearly trips to visit relatives in Minnesota and Florida, I grew up constantly trying to balance the Australian and American parts of my identity. For example, I was convinced that there was no such thing as popular music that originated anywhere other than the USA (the only answer I had when asked about my favorite music at a young age was "Michael Jackson"), but I forged my Aussie side by becoming a die-hard Australian rules football fan, cheering on the St. Kilda Saints (in spite of the wealth of heartache they have provided).

My family moved to Auckland, New Zealand in 1994, starting a trend of international moves that went hand-in-hand with shifting sporting allegiances. In New Zealand, I discovered both soccer and rugby, then in Hong Kong (1996-97) Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny combined to bring basketball to the forefront of my attention. Living in the beautiful countryside of Essex County, England (1998-2002) gave me the invaluable chance to develop my golf game from a young age, and my teenage years in Yokohama, Japan (2002-2006) gave me both professional baseball and sumo wrestling to obsess over.

My international upbringing coupled with my Midwest heritage made Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota an ideal choice for my undergraduate studies. I chose the "follow your passions" path through college, completing a history major while spending almost as much time playing varsity golf and working for the student newspaper, "The Mac Weekly." With the addition of hosting a sports talk radio show and chartering a new student organization, Mac ANZAC (the Macalester Australia and New Zealand Adoration Club), <a href="http://themacweekly.com/2009/11/daniel-kerwins-curated-guide-to-napping/">finding the best spots on campus to power nap was a constant quest of mine.</a>

After a childhood of exploring world capitals, my professional career began with my first taste of small-town life. My first post was as a sports reporter at the Worthington Daily Globe in Southwestern Minnesota, where I saw a level of passion for sports at the high school level that I had never encountered in any of the places that I grew up. My next position was performing the same duties at the New Ulm Journal, located in an idyllic Germanesque town in the Minnesota River Valley.

Three years of small town life brought my lust for international travel back into the forefront of my mind, so my next move was to the biggest city I could find - Tokyo, Japan. I signed on for a one-year stint as an English teacher for AEON Corporation, but again it took three full years in the job until my wanderlust set in again, prompting my return to the United States.

While it goes without saying that my love of sports has provided the broader strokes in the portrait of my life, the spaces in between are filled with various other obsessions I have picked up along the way. While I am no doubt first and foremost a dog person, my family home has always resembled a cat rescue shelter as much as it has an abode for humans. Mention any song by Queen in my presence, and you had best be prepared for an a capella rendition of it coming your way. Start a conversation with me about the culinary delights of the world, and no doubt the merits of British vs. Australian Cadbury chocolate will be included.
