I keep two main blogs, [<b>"Sports Nuts"</b>](http://dksportsnuts.blogspot.com/), which grew out of a sports talk radio program I hosted on Macalester College radio, and [<b>"Chill Time with DK"</b>](http://chilltimewithdk.blogspot.com/), which is a forum for more open-ended subject matter.</br>
You can find descriptions of each blog below.
