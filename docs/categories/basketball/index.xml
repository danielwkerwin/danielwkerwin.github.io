      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in the Worthington Daily Globe on March 12, 2011 about the Jackson County Central girls&amp;rsquo; basketball team&amp;rsquo;s qualification for the state tournament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;MARSHALL &amp;ndash; Thanks to a determined all-around team effort and a well-executed 13-0 first-half run, the ever-hustling Jackson County Central Huskies are state bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Huskies improved to 26-2 for the season and earned their way to the 2011 state high school girls&amp;rsquo; basketball tournament by capturing the Section 3AA championship Friday night with a 57-41 victory over Yellow Medicine East at the R / A Facility on the campus of Southwest Minnesota State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is awesome, just awesome,&amp;rdquo; declared an elated JCC senior forward Brittney Kruse following the post-game awards ceremony. &amp;ldquo;This is what I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for my whole high school career.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kruse, who is called &amp;ldquo;Old Faithful&amp;rdquo; by JCC head coach Tom Schuller, for her remarkable reliability and consistency, scored eight of her 10 points in the first half Friday night, including the team&amp;rsquo;s first four, as the Huskies struggled to score in the opening minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our shooting was a little off at first, but we knew that we had to hustle, play hard on defense and rebound,&amp;rdquo; summed up Kruse about the game&amp;rsquo;s start. &amp;ldquo;Then, once our shots started falling, we put a nice run of points together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kruse was one of four JCC players who scored in double figures in the contest, as the well-balanced Huskies never trailed in the game after 5-10 junior forward Kaylee Benson (team-high 15 points, four rebounds, two steals) connected on the first of her 3-pointers, snapping an early 4-4 deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stringing together 13 unanswered points &amp;ndash; which changed a 7-6 lead to a 20-6 advantage during a span of three minutes and 34 seconds, from the 10:02 mark to when 6:28 showed on the first-half clock &amp;ndash; JCC took a 33-19 advantage into intermission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half, the Huskies had several 13-point leads and held wider spreads of 41-25, 43-27 and 47-29 before the Sting scored seven straight points to trim JCC&amp;rsquo;s lead to 47-36 with 6:56 left in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Conference champions, however, responded with a 6-0 run and with 5:39 to play had increased their lead back to 17 points, 53-36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling the ball well, the Huskies maintained an advantage of 15 to 18 points the rest of the contest, earning the school&amp;rsquo;s first trip back to the Class AA state tournament since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That feels so good,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed senior Courtney Kruse, Brittney&amp;rsquo;s twin sister. &amp;ldquo;Winning this game and going to the state tournament means a lot. It&amp;rsquo;s so awesome and it&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve all been working for all year long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courtney Kruse scored six of her 10 points after intermission, hitting several clutch shots from the right wing, helping JCC maintain its lead through a nearly evenly-played second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth JCC player to notch double figures was 5-5 senior guard Leslie Handzus, who netted 12 points and dished off a game-high nine assists, to go along with five rebounds and a pair of steals. She also deflected seven passes, helping JCC&amp;rsquo;s diversified pressing tactics disrupt YME&amp;rsquo;s offensive flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is one of the best guards that we have played against,&amp;rdquo; praised YME head coach Scott Jans about Handzus. &amp;ldquo;She is so quick and does it all for JCC.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steffen&amp;rsquo;s shot from corner sparks JCC run, Handzus has three assists in 3:34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots of action in the game&amp;rsquo;s first seven minutes, but very little scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JCC came up with the ball often &amp;ndash; both via steal and by rebound &amp;ndash; but the Huskies missed most of their shots, several of which were well off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson&amp;rsquo;s 3-pointer had given JCC a 7-4 edge at around the 12-minute mark (after two earlier baskets by Brittney Kruse), but a nice drive by YME&amp;rsquo;s Angie Scheffler (10:46) yielded the only two points of the next two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with 10:02 on the clock, junior forward Tracey Steffen took a pass from Benson and swished a 16-footer along the left baseline, giving the Huskies a 9-6 edge and triggering what turned out to be a 13-0 run for JCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That was a huge shot,&amp;rdquo; beamed Schuller about Steffen&amp;rsquo;s 2-pointer. &amp;ldquo;We count on all of our kids to step up and shoot the ball when the chance is there and Tracey sure made a nice one when we really needed it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brittney Kruse followed with her second offensive-rebound basket of the game and the lead was 11-6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after a series of deflected passes, Handzus fired a pass to sophomore forward Marita Rasche for a layup, which gave JCC a 13-6 advantage with 7:55 on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight seconds later, Handzus sliced through the retreating YME defense on a transition break down the left sideline and finished with a &amp;ldquo;duck under&amp;rdquo; layup, increasing the lead to eight points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a timeout by Jans, Handzus handed the ball off to Benson who delivered another 3-pointer and, at the 7:04 mark, the Huskies were up by 10, 18-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kaylee had a spectacular game,&amp;rdquo; declared Schuller. &amp;ldquo;She has to work so hard on defense, often guarding the other team&amp;rsquo;s leading scorer, and then she&amp;rsquo;s still able to knock down big shots like those.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two seconds after that, Handzus distributed her third assist of the surge, passing to an open Brittney Kruse in the right corner, who drilled the shot, capping the 13-0 run and giving her team a 20-6 advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YME&amp;rsquo;s Gretchen Rigge scored soon after, snapping the Sting&amp;rsquo;s nearly five-minute drought, but Handzus responded with a 3-pointer from the left corner and with 5:18 to go in the half, JCC was in command, 23-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining five minutes up to intermission were closely-contested, as the Sting regrouped and put together a 7-2 run, trimming the gap to 25-15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flash to the high post by Courtney Kruse (assist Brittney) yielded JCC&amp;rsquo;s only two points during that YME burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the Huskies stayed in control as junior forward Whitney Burmeister and Benson both sank a pair of free throws, Benson scored on a nifty jumper in the lane, and a steal by Courtney Kruse resulted in a Handzus assist to Courtney for a right wing 2-pointer as the half came to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson netted 10 of JCC&amp;rsquo;s first-half points, as a total of seven Huskies scored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All five starters score as JCC maintains lead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handzus (seven) and Courtney Kruse combined for 13 of JCC&amp;rsquo;s second-half points, while Benson (five), Burmeister (four) and Brittney Kruse (two) contributed 11 more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson&amp;rsquo;s third trey of the game &amp;ndash; from the right corner with 16:25 to play &amp;ndash; increased JCC&amp;rsquo;s lead to 36-21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sting cut the gap to 11, 36-25, but two free throws by Burmeister made the score 38-25 with 14 minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither squad scored for several possessions, but a 3-pointer by the ever-versatile Handzus from the deep left corner, lifted JCC to a 41-25 advantage with 12:34 on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Scheffler (eight points) scored on another strong drive for the Sting, the Huskies countered with a basket off a loose ball scramble, which was picked up Rasche (five deflections, three steals) and passed to Courtney Kruse, who passed to her twin sister for a 43-27 JCC lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another assist from Handzus &amp;ndash; this one to Courtney Kruse &amp;ndash; put the Huskies up by 16 (45-29) with 10:17 to play, and then another steal by Rasche (and her assist) gave Benson 15 points and JCC a 47-29 advantage with 9:05 on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sting, which entered the game having won nine of its last 10 games, rallied briefly with a 7-0 run, but the Huskies stayed ahead as Burmeister attacked &amp;ndash; through YME&amp;rsquo;s press &amp;ndash; for a driving field goal from the high post and the score was 49-36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick basket by Courtney Kruse and two free throws by Handzus put the Huskies up by 17, 53-36, with just under six minutes remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Courtney Kruse twice made one-of-two free throws, Handzus dazzled the crowd with another spectacular left-side drive, increasing the lead to 57-39 with 3:53 on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JCC then effectively controlled the game with its four-corner offense and strong defensive rebounding, winning its 12th consecutive game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are just really pleased about winning the section championship,&amp;rdquo; summed up Schuller. &amp;ldquo;Whitney Burmeister has been our leading scorer all season, but in this game, it was our outstanding balance that came through &amp;ndash; as four players scored double figures and Whitney wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them. That&amp;rsquo;s just the type of team we are, all the girls can score and contribute to the total team goal &amp;ndash; which is winning the game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burmeister (six points, three steals, two assists, one block) finished with a team-high seven rebounds for the Huskies, while Brittney Kruse had six rebounds, including four on the offensive end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kruse twins (Brittney, four) combined to deflect seven passes, while Steffen also got her hands on a YME pass, as the Huskies deflected a total of 20 passes in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;JCC&amp;rsquo;s overall athleticism and their ability to play at a high speed was difficult to overcome,&amp;rdquo; summed up Jans, who will return four starters next season from a team which finished 20-7 and claimed the north sub-section championship with a trio of tournament wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yellow Medicine East, I think, is a good team,&amp;rdquo; pointed out Schuller. &amp;ldquo;This was not an easy game because they have a nice all-around team, which plays very good defense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Huskies will play Minnehaha Academy, champions of Section 4AA, at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Target Center in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am so happy for these girls, many of whom have been outstanding multiple-sport performers for us at JCC,&amp;rdquo; concluded Schuller. &amp;ldquo;To get this chance to play in the state tournament is just tremendous for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;YME 19 22 &amp;ndash; 41&lt;/br&gt;
JCC 33 24 &amp;ndash; 57&lt;/br&gt;
YME (3FG-2FG-FT-TP) Rigge 0-2-0-4, Larson 1-3-1-10, Jans 0-3-0-6, Hinz 0-1-4-6, Baker 0-3-1-7, Scheffler 0-4-0-8. Totals 1-16-6-41.&lt;/br&gt;
JCC (3FG-2FG-FT-TP) Handzus 2-2-2-12, B. Kruse 0-5-10, Rasche 0-1-0-2, C. Kruse 0-4-2-10, Benson 3-2-2-15, Steffen 0-1-0-2, Burmeister 0-1-4-6. Totals 5-16-10-57.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in the Worthington Daily Globe on February 1, 2011 about the Jackson County Central girls&amp;rsquo; basketball team&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of qualifying for the state tournament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JACKSON — The Jackson County Central girls’ basketball team doesn’t mind that its undefeated season came to an end with a loss to Marshall on Jan. 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The pressure’s off your back,” Huskie junior Whitney Burmeister said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hair is also off the players’ legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the loss, the players and head coach Tom Schuller had made a pact. They wouldn’t shave their legs until they lost, and he wouldn’t cut his hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea came from Burmeister, who went through the ritual herself last season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Last year I did it, and I tried getting a few others, but they didn’t want to give in then,” Burmeister said. “This year I brought it up again, and they were like, ‘Hey, let’s do it.’ So we did it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s undefeated streak to begin the season reached 13 games, and as the streak went on, the players and their unshaven legs started receiving a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All the students every time you went to school would say, ‘Oh, I want to see your legs! I want to see how hairy they are,’” senior Leslie Handzus said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even people from other schools,” senior Brittney Kruse added. “We went to (Southwest Star Concept) for a game and people were asking us about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pact became so talked about that even some of the players’ mothers made a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-titled “Sasquatch Moms” created home-made hairy legs by cutting up rugs and a gorilla costume, and showed up to watch their daughters wearing the outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know that was coming until they came out, and we looked, and we were like, ‘Oh my goodness,’” Brittney Kruse said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was the most embarrassing moment of our lives,” Handzus added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the players said that the whole experience was embarrassing, but worthwhile, and was definitely a step above the alternative that was posed of going with unshaven armpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The players felt that having hairy legs may have even helped them on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was sweet,” senior Courtney Kruse said. “You honestly kind of felt faster. We thought we kind of played faster, but it was probably in our heads.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We could seriously feel the wind in our hair,” Handzus added. “It was weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the legs are now shaven, the Huskies won’t be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, JCC has usually lacked any significantly tall players. As a result, it has relied on taking a fast-paced approach whenever it is on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s what we do — it’s what we’re known for,” Brittney Kruse said. “Barely ever do we get out of a press. We get out of a press at the end of the game when we’re ahead by whatever, but usually we’re pressing as much as we can, and we’re constantly going fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found out that if we don’t press, we play bad,” Courtney Kruse added. “We play worse if we play slow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on speed has in large part been a contribution of Schuller’s. It’s a philosophy he has drilled into every one of the players since he first began coaching them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working on this pressing and running style basically since they were in eighth grade,” Schuller said. “They’ve had a lot of experience with this fast pace. I don’t think you build that in a year, it’s taken a long time to be that effective on the press and to be able to play that fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three seniors on the team have been playing under Schuller since they were in seventh grade, when they all were bumped up to play on the eighth grade team. Burmeister played on the same team despite being a grade younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Schuller kept progressing from eighth grade coach to varsity coach, the three seniors and Burmeister were with him every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been that the team has developed a very strong sense of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s an advantage we do have over people,” Schuller said. “I really know these players really well, and they know each other really well. I think that’s one of the key things for our success.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the familiarity is that the team is almost literally one big family, with a number of players having sisters or cousins on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Half of us are family,” Burmeister said. “A lot of us are cousins — we’re all related somehow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all that the team has going for it, the loss to Marshall and a further loss on Saturday against Estherville Lincoln Central has shown the team that it is not immune from losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the team has been philosophical about the two losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wish we were (undefeated), but then people are like, ‘It’s probably healthy to lose once,’ because then you’re not like, ‘Oh, I’m sure we’ll win this game,’” Handzus said. “We always have to fight for every game now, because we know that’s there’s teams better than us out there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the end of the season and the section tournament approach, Schuller knows that the team still has its toughest tests ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As you get toward tournament time, all the teams get better,” Schuller said. “They’re better at handling the press, they’re more disciplined at getting back, so the game changes a little bit — everybody’s trying to slow it down a little bit more. We’ve got to continue to get better so we don’t allow them to, because then they force us to do things we’re not as good at.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One factor that has limited JCC’s success in the section tournament the last few years has been running into teams stacked with tall players, but Schuller doesn’t think that will pose as much of a problem this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the section is all tall as it has been in the past,” Schuller said. “I think that’s the difference. I don’t know if a team without a 5-11 player has ever won the section — at least for a long time since I’ve known — and we’re trying to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One team that has always had enough tall players to stand in the team’s way has been Pipestone Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arrows have knocked the Huskies out of the section tournament in each of the past three years, and the Huskies are determined to end that streak this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think sometimes we don’t think we can beat them because we’ve lost to them so many times, but definitely this year’s going to be a lot different,” Handzus said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JCC was scheduled to have its first crack at PA on Monday, but the game was postponed due to Monday’s snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether, the Huskies can create another undefeated streak — and if they do, the team has said they will again refrain from shaving their legs — the big goal for the season will be to make it all the way to the state tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think if we play aggressively and up to our potential, we definitely have a shot,” Handzus said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burmeister feels that with the way things have turned out this season, this is the year that the Huskies are destined to fulfill their goal and make it to the state tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I feel this is the year that we will go,” Burmeister said. “Next year we’ll lose three of our starters, and it’s going to be hard to come back. We’re still going to have good players, but this is the year for us. It’s bound to be us.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
