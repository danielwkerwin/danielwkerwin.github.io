      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in The Mac Weekly on February 26, 2010 about the Macalester Nordic ski team&amp;rsquo;s participation in the Birkebeiner race.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. PAUL - If the brief walk between buildings on campus is sometimes too much for you during the harsh winter months, then you can appreciate how grueling a sport Nordic skiing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, members of Macalester’s Nordic ski team will be taking on one of the sport’s toughest challenges, enduring hours of exposure to the elements as they compete in the American Birkebeiner in northern Wisconsin. It’s not just an average race, but one that coach Ari Ofsevit ’06 describes as “by far the largest and most prestigious race in the [Western] hemisphere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being perhaps the most well known race in America, it’s also one of the most challenging. The event is comprised of three main races, the longest measuring a grueling 54 km. To put this in perspective, a full length marathon is just over 42 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race is tough for even the most experienced skiers, and this year a number of Macalester students are competing in the event for the first time. Some of them don’t have any Nordic ski racing experience at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter is particularly true for Terrence Steinberg ’11. Despite having experience in endurance sports such as triathlon, Steinberg is brand new to Nordic skiing. The Birkebeiner will be his first ever race, and he’ll be participating in the longest of the three races, the 54 km classic race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking toward the race, Steinberg said “I’m optimistic. Even though I don’t have the best technique or most experience, it’ll be an adrenaline rush and I’ll just have fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of his choice to take up Nordic skiing, he said “I just wanted to learn a new sport and use it for cross training, work on my endurance and stuff and be outdoors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emil Mellgren ’10 is coming into the Birkebeiner from a similar place to Steinberg. A fellow triathlete, Mellgren joined the team with a background in Nordic skiing but without any racing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steinberg and Mellgren are just two of the many new members on the team this year. The team was cut as a varsity sport back in 2003, and in recent years has struggled to gain many members.  This year a large crop of experienced first years as well as new upperclassmen like Steinberg and Mellgren has made the team huge, perhaps saving the program from further woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the experienced new first years is Tess Carley ’13. Carley raced heavily in high school, but mostly shorter races; her previous longest race was 33 km. Tomorrow she’ll be competing in the 50 km freestyle race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The 33K was one of the longest days of my life, so I’m a little bit nervous to add on 17 more,” Carley said. “Nordic skiing is just really tiring. I’m hoping to reach a point where I don’t feel my arms anymore, or my legs, that’ll make it easier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow first year Tommy Symms ’13 has already started looking at what waits beyond the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be sweet to be able to brag about doing the biggest race in the Western Hemisphere,” Symms said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While finishing the race in the first place hold enough bragging rights in of itself, the team is looking to make an even bigger impact at the race. The team has entered three teams in the competition, a combination of two over the two longer races and one in the shorter 23 km Kortelopet race. The team will be led by Collin Cousins ’10, who is skiing in the elite wave of the race and is looking to finish in the top 50 in a total field of over 8000 competitors. Ofsevit, who despite being the coach will also be skiing in the elite wave as a member of the team, likes Macalester’s chances of placing high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we have a decent chance to win some hardware,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Sarah Van Etten ’10, racing the Birkie is addictive. “Once you get bitten by the bug you can’t stop doing it,” she said. Van Etten grew up in Spooner, a town about an hour away from the course, and for her each year the Birkie is a huge family event. Come tomorrow morning the first time Birkebeiner skiers on the team will be able to understand why the Birkebeiner is so close to the hearts of so many Nordic skiers the world over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GLBT issues raised at Macalester blood drive</title>
      <link>http://danielwkerwin.com/2017/02/glbt-issues-raised-at-macalester-blood-drive/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in The Mac Weekly on April 9, 2010 about the politics surrounding the GLBT community&amp;rsquo;s access to donating blood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. PAUL - On Wednesday Macalester hosted a blood drive, as happens every semester. And as with every semester, no gay man was able to donate blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a federal restriction prohibiting any &amp;ldquo;male who has had sexual contact with another male, even once, since 1977&amp;rdquo; from donating blood to the Red Cross. Two events took place at the same time as the blood drive to promote awareness of the issue and to gain support to change what is recognized as an outdated policy. Even a group of 18 US senators, led by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry, have called the policy &amp;ldquo;outdated, medically and scientifically unsound.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Phil Duran of OutFront Minnesota, a GLBT advocacy group, spoke at a Pizza and Politics event run by the CEC. The event, held in Davis Court in Markim Hall, attracted a group of approximately 30 students and staff to talk about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duran talked about how blood has historically been a key area of discrimination, something that is no less true in this case. He told of how the policy was put in place because of the AIDS scare in the gay community in the 1970s, but pointed out that despite medical advances in screening for HIV there is still a double standard in place that prohibits gay men from donating blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A heterosexual person who has a sexual relationship with someone who is known to be positive is excluded from donation for a period of a year,&amp;rdquo; Duran said. &amp;ldquo;A man who has a sexual relationship with another man, or just a one time thing, regardless of that person&amp;rsquo;s status, is banned for life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key event raising awareness of the issue on campus this week was a petition against the policy that was available to be signed at the same time that the blood drive was being held. This is the second year a petition has been organized at a blood drive at Macalester. Director of Health &amp;amp; Wellness Denise Ward has witnessed Macalester&amp;rsquo;s blood drives since 1987 and has seen the progression of discussion on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The concern about donor restriction has been a topic of concern around the event for a number of years but it was last year that it was formally addressed by the action of letter writing to encourage change in policy,&amp;rdquo; Ward said. &amp;ldquo;There are strong feelings on both sides of the issue - the ongoing, critical need for blood products and the concern that that the donation policy is more restrictive than it needs to be, denying a significant segment of our population the opportunity to participate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dupre residence hall director Ryan Prosser was an integral part of the planning committee behind the petition. The restriction on gay men donating blood can only be changed if enacted on a federal level, but Prosser feels hopeful the time is coming where a change in the policy is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty hopeful because it&amp;rsquo;s really the first time ever since the policy was enacted that the FDA has considered changing it, this administration is more open to discussing it,&amp;rdquo; Prosser said. &amp;ldquo;I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not some compromise that still feels discriminatory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of Media Services Brian Longley, who is also active on the Wellness and Health at Macalester (WHAM) committee, has been a long time blood donor, but only recently was educated about the restriction against gay men. He helped man the petition table on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been very educational for me, I would say three years ago I was pretty clueless about the fact the restrictions were outdated,&amp;rdquo; Longley said. &amp;ldquo;So many people can&amp;rsquo;t donate for a variety of different reasons, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for this information to breakthrough. There are so many necessary restrictions that some of these unnecessary ones get buried.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with advocacy to change the policy is the problem with confronting the actual process of donating blood. While restrictions against gay men may be outdated and unjustified, there is still a such great need for donated blood that it would be too great a cost to boycott blood drives themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not here to criticize the Red Cross or its colleagues, they have been leaders on this issue,¦ and we should not condemn or criticize the people who take part in blood drives, there is a legitimate need for donations of blood, we should support people who choose to do that,&amp;rdquo; Duran said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By both holding blood drives and also addressing the issue at the same time, Macalester has struck a balance in the situation. The petition will be sent to national representatives to urge their support to change the policy, but until the policy is changes, Macalester will continue holding blood drives with this same balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The balance that has been struck to date is to hold the blood drives, generating a much needed resource and at the same time, using the event to highlight the current donor policy and encourage education and advocacy on the topic,&amp;rdquo; Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nordic team skis with the best at the Birkebeiner race</title>
      <link>http://danielwkerwin.com/2017/02/nordic-team-skis-with-the-best-at-the-birkebeiner-race/</link>

      <guid>http://danielwkerwin.com/2017/02/nordic-team-skis-with-the-best-at-the-birkebeiner-race/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in The Mac Weekly on March 5, 2010 about the Macalester Nordic ski team&amp;rsquo;s results in the Birkebeiner race.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. PAUL - The leader of the Tour de France wears a yellow jersey, but the leader of Macalester&amp;rsquo;s Nordic ski team wears&amp;hellip; pink ski boots? At least that was the case when the team competed in the American Birkebeiner last Saturday, with Collin Cousins &amp;lsquo;10 sporting pink boots as he skied to a 32nd place finish in the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cousins finished with an outstanding time of 2:04:57.4 in the 50 kilometer race, by far the race of his life, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only Macalester skier passing scores of other racers in the field of over 8,000 competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone had good skis and good times, and Collin did extremely well, he was shooting for the top 50 but got 32nd in a pretty tough field,&amp;rdquo; coach Ari Ofsevit &amp;lsquo;06 said. &amp;ldquo;Everyone should be really happy with what they got out of the race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cousins has skied the Birkebeiner well in the past and qualified to race in the elite wave of the field, but his result on Saturday has taken him to a whole new level in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Given that I started training in January, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to finish with the top guys, but I felt strong, pushed to my max, and had fun,&amp;rdquo; Cousins said. &amp;ldquo;The race result means that I need to make a decision whether or not to pursue racing on a professional level or continue to enjoy it casually.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofsevit said that if Cousins chooses to focus hard on ski training after graduating in May he has the potential to have a bright future in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s the kind of guy that with training he could turn out some really top level results; he&amp;rsquo;s pretty darn close already,&amp;rdquo; Ofsevit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Cousins came into the race as a seasoned skier, most of the team was competing in the Birkebeiner for the first time. Many of these skiers were optimistic when interviewed before the race in last week&amp;rsquo;s Mac Weekly. This optimism turned out to be completely justified. Macalester placed highly compared to other collegiate teams in the event, finishing fourth in the full length Birkebeiner and first in the shorter Kortelopet race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terence Steinberg &amp;lsquo;11 was one of the first time racers who had a good experience in not only his first ever Birkebeiner, but his first ever ski race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was a lot easier than I thought it would be,&amp;rdquo; Steinberg said. &amp;ldquo;I was worried I&amp;rsquo;d have to go in and be humbled by the whole thing, but it was actually a huge confidence booster, which was really sweet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emil Mellgren &amp;lsquo;10 was also racing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something you ask yourself is &amp;lsquo;Why am I doing this?&amp;rsquo; - your body wants you to stop, but it&amp;rsquo;s a really good feeling when you keep going,&amp;rdquo; Mellgren said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Birkebeiner has become an obsession for skiers worldwide. Mellgren experienced this when he unexpectedly ran into a family friend from Sweden while competing. The race has become so popular that fans line vast stretches of the course of the race, which ends on the streets of downtown Hayward, Wis. Tess Carley &amp;lsquo;13 appreciated the support the spectators provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Saturday was a beautiful day and it was crazy to be amongst so many Nordic skiers,&amp;rdquo; Carley said. &amp;ldquo;All of the crazy fans cheering along the way made it easier to finish, and there was a lot of adrenaline after waking up at 5:30 to ski with 8,400 other people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team made vast progress with all the new skiers this season, the culmination of which was seen at the Birkebeiner, boding well for the program&amp;rsquo;s future. However, the team will suffer a blow with a large proportion of the team graduating this May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we fared really well as a team,&amp;rdquo; Steinberg said. &amp;ldquo;Unfortunately most of the team is seniors this year so we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to build on it as much as we could have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the team is always open to have new people come out and try the sport. Ofsevit stresses that the program isn&amp;rsquo;t concerned foremost with racing results, but that &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s really about going out, having a good time and improving year after year and month after month.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofsevit will be holding a clinic this Sunday for anyone who is interested in learning how to ski, and absolute beginners are more than welcome. Details can be found alongside this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who is interested in trying Nordic skiing, Steinberg and Mellgren are two good examples that Nordic skiing is a good way not only to get out and enjoy the winter months, but it potentially opens new doors too. Both intend to compete in a biathlon event this Sunday, the first time either will have attempted the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s just something about skiing around in the woods with a gun on your back that speaks to the Northern Swede in me,&amp;rdquo; Mellgren said. &amp;ldquo;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;ll be next year&amp;rsquo;s project.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zinn takes on &#39;just&#39; wars at inaugural philosophy colloquium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is an article of mine that was published in The Mac Weekly on April 10, 2009, in which I interviewed renowned historian Howard Zinn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. PAUL - Although Henry West retired last year after 44 years as a philosophy professor at Macalester, he&amp;rsquo;s not done giving to the college. On Tuesday, he made it possible for his friend of over 50 years, Howard Zinn, to come to campus as the first speaker in the inaugural Henry West Philosophy Colloquium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone unfamiliar with him, Howard Zinn is kind of a big deal. The majority of those in attendance knew this and gave him a standing ovation before he even said a word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinn is one of the most, if not the most, well known names in the field of American history. His book &amp;ldquo;A People&amp;rsquo;s History of the United States&amp;rdquo; is a part of the syllabus in high schools around the country, even though Zinn admits that when the book first came out it was meant more for the general public, and high school teachers were reluctant to use it. Today it has sold around two million copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinn&amp;rsquo;s talk on Monday centered around whether or not there is such thing as a &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; cause for war, focusing specifically on the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil War and World War II. Zinn characterized these as the three &amp;ldquo;holy&amp;rdquo; wars since they are wars in which their just cause is seldom questioned, but he did just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like to claim I make distinctions that aren&amp;rsquo;t often made,&amp;rdquo; Zinn said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Zinn is currently 86 years old and a bit hard of hearing, he talked about the subject as if he could have gone on forever. At some points it seemed that he would go on forever, but he managed to reluctantly restrain himself in the interest of time. On one such occasion, he took a token look at his watch and proclaimed &amp;ldquo;Let me look at my watch to pretend that I care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinn looked at the three wars by Placing them on a &amp;ldquo;balance sheet,&amp;rdquo; balancing the just causes they were fought for against the casualties and hardships caused along the way. He talked about a version of history that has not traditionally been brought to light, such as mutinies that occurred during the Revolutionary War and draft riots during the Civil War. Zinn, who himself served as a bombardier in World War II, also talked of the atrocities of the mass bombings by the so called &amp;ldquo;good side&amp;rdquo; in the war in places such as Dresden and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a reality to these atrocities that&amp;rsquo;s very hard to convey, but it must be taken into consideration,&amp;rdquo; Zinn said. &amp;ldquo;You go into war and you&amp;rsquo;re the good guys and they&amp;rsquo;re the bad guys, but as the war proceeds you become the bad guys also.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, Zinn drove home his concluding point that humanity has to do away with war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we&amp;rsquo;re at a point in human history where we have to decide that war is not the solution,&amp;rdquo; Zinn said. &amp;ldquo;The human race is supposed to be smart; we should be smart enough to find ways to solve our problems without war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some it may seem that Zinn is stating an obvious necessity, but there is no doubt that the message takes on an added power coming from a man with such a storied past such as Zinn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinn not only has spent his career writing history, he has been a participant in many important movements. He was involved with Civil Rights activism in the late 1950s, before the brunt of the movement started, while he was a professor at Spellman College in Atlanta, describing himself as a &amp;ldquo;writer-participant&amp;rdquo; in the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spellman College is where he met Henry West. Together with their wives, they were involved together in what Zinn called &amp;ldquo;guerilla actions against segregation&amp;rdquo; with their students. They worked together on desegregating the Atlanta Public Library, and on one occasion brought African American members of a theater group into a municipal auditorium, despite the action being strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his academic career, Zinn has taken his role as writer-participant to heart, and believes that history should be taught with the same principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Education is not a neutral thing, education should have a social objective,&amp;rdquo; Zinn said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinn&amp;rsquo;s visit to campus was a stong start to the series, and not without moments of excitement. There was a point at the beginning of his talk where it looked like the audience may not get to hear him talk after all when Zinn took his time bending down to pick up some notes he dropped on the floor, but he rebounded from the situation by exhibiting his sharp humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t worried that I would never get up; it would be a very dramatic way to end my lecture,&amp;rdquo; Zinn said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
